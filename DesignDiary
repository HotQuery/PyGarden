Began implementing a background, finished conceptualizing the project idea and began researching on methods
to be implemented namely:

Sun object to move across the sky as a type of game timer
plant objects to place within a garden plot in the game
Creating buttons on the side of the game for :
watering
add nutrients
digging holes?
fighting off bugs with a garden trowel? >>> click bugs approaching garden to make them disappear?

Will also be thinking about background music and sound effects
